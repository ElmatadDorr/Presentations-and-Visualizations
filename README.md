# Presentations-and-Visualizations
Notable Presentations and Visualizations from past work

1) APH Annual Plan Presentation - This introduced a format to publishing data from Austin Public Health to our public facing data warehouse that initiated and 
planned data publishing in a regimented and methodical way.

2) APH Data Automation Presentation - This introduced the Pseudo - ETL pipeline I created with the tools available to me at work, using an OSQL Data Warehouse, A Server, 
Python scripts and APIs we were able to create a method for non technical users to automate their own data.

3) Dogs and Cats Tableau Improvement - This is a tableau Improvement of the lost strays map that can be found Here:(https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Found-Pets-Map/hye6-gvq2).I created this map because I heard that when people lost their pets they were being directed to this map, I thought the map could be made more intuitive and useful by adding an automatic web search for the image of the animal so that people can quickly identify if this was their lost pet.

4) Open Data Annual Plan Documentation - This was created as documentation to go along with the Annual Plan as this was a big undertaking at the time and would 
require significantly more work from our program managers.
